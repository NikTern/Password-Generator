# Password-Generator
Password generator! Built using HTML, CSS, Javascript.

## Description

This project is a password generator. Upon clicking the 'generate password' button, a series of prompts appear for the user to create a custom password. The user specifies a desired password length, and the character types (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special) they would like their password to possess.

This project served as an opportunity to practice JavaScript, particularly functions, loops and recursion. It improved my understanding of the syntax of JavaScript, as well as the nuances of logical operators and comparators.

## Installation

The project can be accessed at: https://niktern.github.io/Password-Generator/

## Usage

Click the 'generate password' button to begin generating a password.

If an invalid input is given by the user, they will be alerted and then made to re-enter a new input. If no character types are selected by the user, they will be alerted that they need to select at least one character type -- and then be re-presented the prompts again.

Upon successfully selecting Y or N for a given prompt, the user will receive a confirmatory message.
